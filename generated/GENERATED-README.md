_!! generated content: do not modify by hand !!_

The contents of this directory are compiled from the `assets/` dir along with
files generated by running

```shell
$ cargo xtask gen
```

The `fuzzer-syntaxes.bin` is the `generated/syntaxes-fancy-newlines.bin` file
without the patches from `patches/` applied. That's the file used for the fuzz
targets that verify the unpatched syntaxes match the patched syntaxes since the
patches are exclusively various optimizations. `fancy` was picked to get more
pure-Rust dependencies to ensure the fuzzer coverage info is good there.
`newlines` is a more arbitrary choice, but is also generally supposed to be the
"correct" one to use
